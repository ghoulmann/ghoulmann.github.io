Supporting site for [*Learning Proxmox VE*, my first book from Packt Publishing], is coming together at [http://learningproxmoxve.org](http://learningproxmoxve.org).

Original content will very soon start accumulating.

The book is expected to be released by Packt on March 31, and will be available as both a paperbound volume and DRM-free e-text directly from [Packt Pub](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/learning-proxmox-ve).

>  Proxmox VE 4.1 provides an open source, enterprise virtualization platform on which to host virtual servers as either virtual machines or containers.

> This book will support your practice of the requisite skills to successfully create, tailor, and deploy virtual machines and containers with Proxmox VE 4.1. Following a survey of PVE's features and characteristics,this book will contrast containers with virtual machines and establish cases for both. It walks through the installation of Proxmox VE, explores the creation of containers and virtual machines, and suggests best practices for virtual disk creation, network configuration, and Proxmox VE host and guest security. Throughout the book, you will navigate the Proxmox VE 4.1 web interface and explore options for command-line management.

Here's a mockup of the cover:
