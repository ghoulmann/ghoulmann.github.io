So pleased to offer authorized Proxmox VE training in the US throughout 2017. Instructor-led training events will be held in the following months:

* March
* May
* July
* September
* November


I am so very pleased to be able to say that the authorized Proxmox VE trainings being offered in the US since August, 2016 have been going phenomenally well. The feedback has been both positive and helpful. Participants seem particularly pleased with the collaborative learning strategies that structure the training.

I note, of course, that Proxmox Server Solutions [released version 4.4](https://www.proxmox.com/en/news/press-releases/proxmox-ve-4-4) of Proxmox VE earlier this month.

Naturally, these training events will provide support for this newest release.

## In House Training


I want to be sure that I'm clear that in-house training is available for teams looking to work with Proxmox virtualization. In-house training can be customized and manipulated so they serve the needs of your teams.

I offer in-house training for precisely those situations in which more than two people in an organization are ready to harness everything that Proxmox VE has to offer: the in-house training is provided to save your organization travel expenses.

Contact me about in-house training: I'm currently available to travel to your team in February, April, June, August, October, and December.
