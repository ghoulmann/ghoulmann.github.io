E. Gabriella Coleman's [*Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy: The Many Faces of Anonymous*](http://www.versobooks.com/books/2027-hacker-hoaxer-whistleblower-spy) is such a tremendous success as a work of scholarship, and probably as popular reading as well: all the ingredients are there for both outstanding research and popular fascination.

I wonder though if it hasn't displaced or dislodged Coleman's earlier anthropology of hacker culture, *Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking*. It's a seminal work, and belongs on any syllabus alongside the other greats.

I don't want to see it lost in the shadows of the success of *Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower*.
