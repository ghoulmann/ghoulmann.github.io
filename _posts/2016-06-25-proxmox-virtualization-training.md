Very pleased to announce authorized Proxmox virtualization training in the United States.

<p class="rtecenter"><center><img src="/images/Proxmox-logo-600px.png" /></center></p>

Proxmox VE offers an enterprise-class, open source hypervisor that supports HA clusters, live migration, and much more. It's a fantastic host for virtual servers, both virtual machines and containers (LXC).

Three course options are available:

1. Proxmox VE Installation and Configuration (2 days)
2. Proxmox VE Advanced (2 days)
3. Bundle of both courses (4 days)

Participants receive certificates from Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH after the completion of each course.

The first session is scheduled for July 17-18, 2016 in downtown Washington, DC. The schedule will populate rapidly.

Keep in mind, however, that in-house training can also be arranged.
