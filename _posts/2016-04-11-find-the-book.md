II did a thing. It's done: *Learning Proxmox VE* is available in print and as a DRM-free ebook.

It's available at the usual suspects - [I link to resellers as I find them](http://learningproxmoxve.org/tagged/find-the-book).

There's an article published at Packt Pub's site on Proxmox VE Fundamentals. This is the first chapter of *Learning Proxmox VE* in its entirety. [Bam](https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/proxmox-ve-fundamentals).

More content from the book is available at Slideshare; it's described as a sample chapter, and is, in fact, Chapter 7 of the title. It covers Proxmox VE host and guest security and is available [here](http://www.slideshare.net/PacktPub/learning-proxmox-ve-sample-chapter).

I chose Packt because I'm committed to keeping content [DRM-free](http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management). True story. More filth [here](https://www.packtpub.com/books/info/authors/rik-goldman).

To buy DRM-free, order as print or ebook directly from [Packt Pub](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/learning-proxmox-ve) or through [O'Reilly Media](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781783981786.do).
