# Proxmox VE 4 Getting a UI Overhaul

As foretold by the Proxmox VE [Roadmap](http://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Roadmap#Roadmap), PVE is getting a UI overhaul that relies on Sencha Ext JS 6.x.

Sometime the week of April 10, 2016, the change was added to the [pvetest](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Package_repositories) repository.

In the following video, I offer a brief glimpse at the changes coming to PVE's UI:

Here're other changes to expect in the near future:

* latest kernels (4.4 for Proxmox VE 4.2)
* LVM-thin improvements
* LetÂ´s Encrypt
* GUI update to Sencha Ext JS 6.x (soon now)
* support for external fencing devices
* DRBD9 improvements
* Cloudinit
* Linux Containers (LXC) live-migration (experimental)
* unprivileged LXC
* new documentation framework

To take it for a spin (on a machine not used for production), try the following:

    echo "deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian jessie pvetest" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pvetest.list

    apt-get update

    apt-get -y upgrade

    apt-get -y dist-upgrade

(Be sure the other PVE repositories are disabled.)
