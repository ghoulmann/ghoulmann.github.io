A hearty congratulations (and thanks) thanks to Tim Bielawa, whose first book, *The Linux Sysadmin' Guide to Virtual Disks* was released earlier this month.

Tim's book is the first of it's kind, covering just about everything you need to know about the most widely-used virtual disk formats in a single text.

From http://scribeguides.com:

>  The Linux Sysadmin's Guide to Virtual Disks demonstrates the core concepts of virtual disk management. Real-world problems are covered in the book's "Cookbook" section. Other topics include: helper utilities, disk formats, troubleshooting tips, performance considerations, and comprehensive appendices.

Tremendous effort meticulously invested in this text. Thankfully, Bielawa, a developer at RedHat and fellow WVU alum, made a draft of the work in progress available while I was writing [*Learning Proxmox VE* for Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/learning-proxmox-ve); it had a tremendous effect on the outcome of my chapter on virtual disks.

* Purchase the book from [Lulu](https://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/the-linux-sysadmins-guide-to-virtual-disks/18420783) for a modest $10 to support Bielewa's efforts.
* The book is also available electronically from Tim's new imprint, Scribeguides, at [http://scribeguides.com](http://scribeguides.com).
